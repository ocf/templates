Hi Hostmaster,

Could you please make the following changes to the DNS?

Drop the following records:

{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU. IN A 169.229.226.23 (single A, no PTR)
{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU. IN AAAA 2607:f140:8801::1:23 (single AAAA, no PTR)

And add the following records:

{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU. IN A 169.229.226.49 (single A, no PTR)
{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU. IN AAAA 2607:f140:8801::1:49 (single AAAA, no PTR)

Thanks!
