Hi {group},

The staff at the OCF noticed that your group's website [1] may be missing a
"Hosted by OCF" banner [2] or the University-mandated "student group
disclaimer" [3]. All student group websites must display both elements to
comply with OCF virtual hosting policy and University trademark
regulation. If your website isn't fully compliant, we will have to
temporarily disable it to comply with these requirements. We'll check back
in about two weeks, so please try to make any needed changes by then.

Your username is "{username}".

If you've forgotten how to log in, instructions can be found here [4]. If
you've forgotten your password, you can reset it here [5].

Feel free to reply all to this email if you have any questions or if we can
help with making the change! Please include help@ocf.berkeley.edu if you
would like a response.

Thanks for flying OCF,
The friendly staff of 171 MLK Student Union
