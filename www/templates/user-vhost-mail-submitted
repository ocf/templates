We've completed the setup of your mail virtual host on our end, and
forwarded the DNS portion of the request to the university hostmaster.

It usually takes them about a business week or two to make the change; after
that, your mail forwarding will be live.

You can find details about using our mail forwarding service on our
website:

Please note that the university hostmaster may request additional information,
reject your request, or require an alternative hostname be used. The OCF
will notify you if something like this occurs.

Let us know if you have any questions!
