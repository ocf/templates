Hi {name},

I've added you to the HPC user group, so you can now SSH into
hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu and start running jobs.
If you haven't already, please check out our HPC documentation to see
how to get started: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/hpc/

Please be mindful of other HPC users and try not to allocate all of our
resources for more than a couple hours at a time.

If you have any questions or issues using HPC, please let us know via
email or on the #hpc_users channel on our IRC or Slack. You can find
how to log into our IRC and Slack here:
https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/contact/

Welcome aboard!
