Hi {name},

I've added you to the HPC user group, so you can now SSH into
hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu and start running jobs.
If you haven't already, please check out our HPC documentation to see
how to get started: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/hpc/

Please be mindful of other HPC users and try not to allocate all of our
resources for more than a couple hours at a time.

Also, please note that hpcctl is a low-powered login server,
and all the CPUs, memory, and GPUs are on corruption.
You'll only be able to access them through Slurm.

If you have any questions or issues using HPC, please let us know via
email or on the #rebuild channel on our IRC or Discord. You can find
how to log into our IRC here: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/contact
or join our Discord: https://ocf.io/discord

Welcome aboard!
